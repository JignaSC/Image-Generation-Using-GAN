# Image-Generation-Using-GAN
The **generator** learns to generate plausible data. The generated instances become negative training examples for the discriminator.\
The **discriminator** learns to distinguish the generator's fake data from real data. The discriminator penalizes the generator for producing implausible results.\
Both Generator and Discriminators are Neural Networks.\
* First train Discriminator with real images and set target to **1** and then Train Discriminator with fake images and set target to **0** (To distingushed between what's real and what's fake)
* Fake images are the images generated by generator
* Loss: Binary Cross Entropy
* Back Propagation Error:
  * Discriminator: error real (1) + error fake (0)
  * Generator: error fake (0)
* Weight update:
  * Discriminator: With the gradient of original Image
  * Generator: With the gradient of fake Images
  
**Loss of Generator and Discriminator does not change that much. It remains almost constant because both are learning simultaneously.\
Unlike regression and classification loss will not decrease after every epochs.**
